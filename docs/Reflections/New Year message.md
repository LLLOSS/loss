BEIJING -- On New Year's eve, President Xi Jinping delivered his 2025 **New Year message** through **China Media Group** （中央广播电视总台）and the internet. The following is the full text of the message:



大家好！时间过得很快，新的一年即将到来，我在北京向大家致以美好的祝福！

Greetings to everybody! Time flies fast, and the new year will **be with us shortly.** I extend my best wishes to **you all**（你们） from Beijing.



2024年，我们一起走过春夏秋冬，一道经历风雨彩虹，一个个瞬间定格在这不平凡的一年，令人感慨、难以忘怀。

In 2024, we have together **journeyed through** the four seasons. Together, we have experienced winds and rains and seen rainbows. Those **touching and unforgettable** （令人感概、难以忘怀）moments have been like still frames showing how extraordinary a year we have had.

我们积极应对国内外环境变化带来的影响，出台一系列政策“组合拳”，扎实推动高质量发展，我国经济回暖向好，国内生产总值预计超过130万亿元。粮食产量突破1.4万亿斤，中国碗装了更多中国粮。区域发展协同联动、积厚成势，新型城镇化和乡村振兴相互融合、同频共振。绿色低碳发展纵深推进，美丽中国画卷徐徐铺展。

We have proactively responded to the impacts of the changing environment at home and abroad. We have adopted a full range of policies **to make solid gains in pursuing high-quality development.** China's economy has rebounded and is on an **upward trajectory**, with its GDP for the year expected to pass the 130 trillion yuan mark. Grain output has surpassed 700 million tons, and China's bowls are now filled with more Chinese grain. **Coordinated development across regions has gained stronger momentum**, and **mutually reinforcing advances** have been made in both **new urbanization and rural revitalization.** Green and low-carbon development has been further **enhanced**. Indeed, a more beautiful China is unfolding before us.



我们因地制宜培育新质生产力，新产业新业态新模式竞相涌现，新能源汽车年产量首次突破1000万辆，集成电路、人工智能、量子通信**等领域**取得新成果。嫦娥六号首次月背采样，梦想号探秘大洋，深中通道踏浪海天，南极秦岭站崛起冰原，展现了中国人逐梦星辰大海的豪情壮志。

We have fostered new quality productive forces **in light of actual conditions.** New business sectors, forms and models have **kept emerging**. For the first time, China has produced more than 10 million new energy vehicles in a year. Breakthroughs have been made in integrated circuit, artificial intelligence, quantum communication**s** and **many other fields.** Also for the first time, the **Chang'e 6 lunar probe** collected samples from **the far side of the moon**. **The Mengxiang drilling vessel** explored the mystery of the deep ocean. The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link now connects the two cities across the sea. The Antarctic Qinling Station is now in operation on the frozen continent. All this **epitomizes** the lofty spirit and dreams of the Chinese people to explore stars and oceans.



今年，我到地方考察，看到大家生活多姿多彩。天水花牛苹果又大又红，东山澳角村渔获满舱。麦积山石窟“东方微笑”跨越千年，六尺巷礼让家风代代相传。天津古文化街人潮熙攘，银川多民族社区居民亲如一家。对大家关心的就业增收、“一老一小”、教育医疗等问题，我一直挂念。一年来，基础养老金提高了，房贷利率下调了，直接结算范围扩大方便了异地就医，消费品以旧换新提高了生活品质……大家的获得感又充实了许多。

This year, I have visited many places across the country and seen **how our people enjoy their enriching lives.** I saw the big, red Huaniu apples in Tianshui, Gansu and the fishing boats in Aojiao village, Fujian **loaded with their catches.** I watched the **millenium-old** "Eastern Smile" in the Maiji Mountain **Grottoes**, and I learned more about good-neighborliness （neighborliness-友善亲切） passed from generation to generation in Liuchixiang Alley. I enjoyed the hustle and bustle in Tianjin's Ancient Culture Street, and I saw how the people in Yinchuan's mixed-ethnic residential communities live together as one family. The concerns of the people about jobs and incomes, elderly and child care, education and medical **services** are always on my mind. **This year,** basic pension has been raised, and mortgage rates have dropped. **Cross-province direct settlement of medical bills** has been expanded, making it easier for people to seek medical treatment across the country. And consumer goods trade-in programs have improved people's lives... All these are real benefits to our people.



巴黎奥运赛场上，我国体育健儿**奋勇争先**，取得境外参赛最好成绩，彰显了青年一代的昂扬向上、自信阳光。海军、空军喜庆75岁生日，人民子弟兵展现新风貌。

In the Paris Olympics, Chinese athletes **raced to the top** and achieved their best performance in Olympic Games held overseas, fully **demonstrating** the **vigor and confidence** of young Chinese. **The PLA Navy and Air Force** celebrated their 75th birthdays, and our servicemen and women are **full of drive.** 



面对洪涝、台风等自然灾害，广大党员干部冲锋在前，大家众志成城、守望相助。无数劳动者、建设者、创业者，都在为梦想拼搏。我为国家勋章和国家荣誉称号获得者颁奖，光荣属于他们，也属于每一个挺膺担当的奋斗者。

When **floods**, typhoons and other natural disasters struck, members of the Communist Party of China and officials stepped forward to lead disaster relief efforts（effort 特别行动）, and our people were **of one mind**（心往一处想） and **reached out** to each other. 

People in all fields — workers**,** builders and entrepreneurs**,** among others — are working hard to fulfill their dreams. I presented awards to recipients of national medals and honorary titles. The honor belongs to them; it also belongs to every hard-working person who has **lived up to** （履行）their responsibilities.



当今世界变乱交织，中国作为负责任大国，积极推动全球治理变革，深化全球南方团结合作。我们推进高质量共建“一带一路”走深走实，成功举办中非合作论坛北京峰会，在上合、金砖、亚太经合组织、二十国集团等双边多边场合，鲜明提出中国主张，为维护世界和平稳定注入更多正能量。

In a world of both transformation（变） and turbulence（乱）, China, as a responsible major country, is actively promoting global governance reform and deepening solidarity and cooperation among **the Global South**. 

We are making deeper（深） and more substantive（实） **advances**（进展） in high-quality **Belt and Road cooperation**. **The Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation** was **a full success**. We put forward China's **vision** at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, APEC, G20 and **other bilateral and multilateral forums.** We have contributed greatly to the maintenance of world peace and stability.



我们隆重庆祝新中国成立75周年，深情回望共和国的沧桑巨变。从五千多年中华文明的传承中一路走来，“中国”二字镌刻在“何尊”底部，更铭刻在每个华夏儿女心中。党的二十届三中全会胜利召开，吹响进一步全面深化改革的号角。我们乘着改革开放的时代大潮阔步前行，中国式现代化必将在改革开放中开辟更加广阔的前景。

We celebrated **the 75th anniversary of the founding of New China**. **With deep affection, we looked back at the sea change that has taken place across China since the birth of the People's Republic.** 

Nurtured by our 5,000-plus years of continuous civilization, our country, China, is engraved not only on the bottom of the **ancient bronze ritual wine vessel of He Zun**, but also in the heart of every Chinese. 

**At its Third Plenary Session, the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sounded a clarion call for further deepening all-round reform.** 

We will march forward **in great strides**（大步） to advance（v.促进、推进） **reform and opening up** as the trend of our times. 

We will surely embrace **even** broader prospects in pursuing Chinese modernization in the course of reform and opening up.



2025年，我们将全面完成“十四五”规划。要实施更加积极有为的政策，聚精会神抓好高质量发展，推动高水平科技自立自强，保持经济社会发展良好势头。当前经济运行面临一些新情况，有外部环境不确定性的挑战，有新旧动能转换的压力，但这些经过努力是可以克服的。我们从来都是在风雨洗礼中成长、在历经考验中壮大，大家要充满信心。

In 2025, we will fully complete the 14th Five-Year Plan. 

We will 

**implement** more proactive（积极） and effective（有为） policies,

The Chinese economy now faces some new conditions, including challenges of uncertainties in the external environment and pressure of transformation from old growth drivers into new ones. 

But we can prevail（战胜、克服、取得胜利） with our hard work. **As always,** （从来）we grow in the wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be confident.



家事国事天下事，让人民过上幸福生活是头等大事。家家户户都盼着孩子能有好的教育，老人能有好的养老服务，年轻人能有更多发展机会。这些朴实的愿望，就是对美好生活的向往。我们要一起努力，不断提升社会建设和治理水平，持续营造和谐包容的氛围，把老百姓身边的大事小情解决好，让大家笑容更多、心里更暖。

Of all the jobs in front of us, the most important is to ensure a happy life for our people. Every family hopes that their children can have a good education, their seniors can enjoy good elderly services, and their youngsters can have more and better opportunities. 

**These simple wishes are our people's aspirations for a better life.**

We should work together to 

steadily improve social undertakings and governance,

在澳门回归祖国25周年之际，我再到濠江之畔，新发展新变化令人欣喜。我们将坚定不移贯彻“一国两制”方针，保持香港、澳门长期繁荣稳定。两岸同胞一家亲，谁也无法割断我们的血脉亲情，谁也不能阻挡祖国统一的历史大势！

On the eve of the 25th anniversary of **Macao**'s return to the motherland, I visited the city again, and I was **gratified** to see the new progress and changes there. 

We will **unswervingly** implement the policy of **One Country, Two Systems** to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. 

We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same family.
两岸同胞一家亲

No one **can ever** sever the bond of kinship between us, and no one can ever stop China's reunification, a trend of **the times**.

- **can ever**：表示“能够（永远）”，其中 **ever** 加强语气，指的是“**任何时候**”。
- 注意是sever（切割，断绝关系） 不是serve



世界百年变局加速演进，需要以宽广胸襟超越隔阂冲突，以博大情怀关照人类命运。中国愿同各国一道，做友好合作的践行者、文明互鉴的推动者、构建人类命运共同体的参与者，共同开创世界的美好未来。

As changes unseen in a century accelerate across the world, it is important to rise above estrangement and conflict **with a broad vision**, and care for the future of humanity with great passion. 

- **changes unseen in a century**：这是“百年未有之大变局”的英文表达。

**梦虽遥，追则能达；愿虽艰，持则可圆。**中国式现代化的新征程上，每一个人都是主角，每一份付出都弥足珍贵，每一束光芒都熠熠生辉。

**Dreams （梦）and wishes（愿） may be far, but they can be fulfilled with dedicated（专注地、持续地） pursuit.** 

On the new journey of Chinese modernization,

 everyone is a key actor, 

every effort counts,

 and every ray of light shines.
